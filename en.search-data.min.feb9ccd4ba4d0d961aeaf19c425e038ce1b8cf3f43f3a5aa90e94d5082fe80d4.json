We very rarely make a complete census of all individuals in a population or all sites on a landscape. Sometimes we don\u0026rsquo;t collect, or can\u0026rsquo;t collect, complete information for individual samples or measures. For instance, we might know an animal was alive when it was last seen, so we know it survived at least that long, but know nothing about its current status. Or we might have information on the coverage of an invasive species down to a certain patch size, beyond which patches are too small or numerous to survey.\nAll of these examples involve missing data. It probably goes without saying that estimating population level parameters in light of such \u0026ldquo;missingness\u0026rdquo; is a challenge. We cannot compute a population mean if one or more values are missing.\n 6 NA 9 NA 9 NA 5 6 9 7 2  The mean for such a string of numbers is undefined.1 In some settings these missing data can be safely ignored, but these circumstances are rarely met in ecological studies.

An incomplete data perspective provides a general framework for resolving this sampling problem and making inference.\n  If you\u0026rsquo;re an R person and you thought, \u0026ldquo;why not just include an na.rm = TRUE in the call to mean()\u0026rdquo;, kudos!

To be useful and robust, however, they require precise (mathematical) definitions. It has been my experience that misunderstanding these terms can lead to misapplication of model predictions and to researchers and managers drawing the wrong conclusions from the data. In this post we show how relatively simple, even intuitive, definitions for each of these terms clarifies their intent, and improves the insights provided by models of monitoring data.\nFor context, it is helpful to see how these terms have been used previously in the literature\n The ‘term “trend” [is] a description of an overall tendency, without regard to fluctuations in the trajectory. The distinction between the terms has important consequences for analysis and interpretation of survey data. Trend describes the change in a population over a specific interval; trajectory describes the manner in which the change occurred.\n \u0026ndash; Link and Sauer 1998\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/models-for-missing-data/docs/guide/usage/gui/","title":"Graphical user interface","section":"Usage","content":"Graphical user interface (RStudio) #  "},{"id":8,"href":"/models-for-missing-data/docs/guide/metadata-syntax/model-block/link/","title":"Link function","section":"Model Block","content":"Deterministic (link) function for the regression on the mean #  deterministic model: - inverse-logit  "},{"id":9,"href":"/models-for-missing-data/docs/guide/analysis-inputs/monitoring-data/","title":"Monitoring data","section":"Analysis inputs","content":"Monitoring data #  The data exists in a file structure that is similar to that seen in the config directory, but is generally more flexible beneath the network-level of the hierarchy.
