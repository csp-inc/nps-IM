# Welcome to Models for Missing Data

This website serves as a storehouse of information about software used by several National Park Service [Inventory & Monitoring (I&M) networks](https://www.nps.gov/im/networks.htm) to develop models of the status and trends of park resources. It also features general-interest articles introducing statistical concepts and applications of models.
