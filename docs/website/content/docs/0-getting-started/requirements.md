# Requirements

The requirements include R (v4.X.X) and RStudio (if you'd like to work with __models-for-missing-data__ interactively), and JAGS (v4.3.0). Git and Git Bash (for Windows users) are convenient if you'd like to stay up to date with the latest changes.

The requirements (including a few non-essentials) are described in the latest Dockerfile. You're likely to need everything you see beneath `install2.r` in the instructions below. You can install these from your R console with `install.packages()`.
