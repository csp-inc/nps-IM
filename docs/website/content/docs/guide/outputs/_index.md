# Outputs

All outputs (including logs) are stored in the 'output' directory, which mirrors -- _almost_ exactly -- the structure of the 'config' directory. The only difference is that the results of analyses for each state variable are stored separately, whereas the configuration of analyses for like-variables (related count or cover variables, for example) can be specified simultaneously in the same YAML file.
