&amp;ndash; Little 2013
Nearly all samples &amp;ndash; whether by design or by accident &amp;ndash; are incomplete. We very rarely make a complete census of all individuals in a population or all sites on a landscape. Sometimes we don&amp;rsquo;t collect, or can&amp;rsquo;t collect, complete information for individual samples or measures. For instance, we might know an animal was alive when it was last seen, so we know it survived at least that long, but know nothing about its current status.</description></item><item><title>Disentangling concepts of status, trend, and trajectory</title><link>https://lzachmann.github.io/models-for-missing-data/posts/trend-vs-trajectory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lzachmann.github.io/models-for-missing-data/posts/trend-vs-trajectory/</guid><description>The terms status and trend are ubiquitous in resource monitoring and management settings. To be useful and robust, however, they require precise (mathematical) definitions. It has been my experience that misunderstanding these terms can lead to misapplication of model predictions and to researchers and managers drawing the wrong conclusions from the data. In this post we show how relatively simple, even intuitive, definitions for each of these terms clarifies their intent, and improves the insights provided by models of monitoring data.</description></item><item><title>Sampling and populations</title><link>https://lzachmann.github.io/models-for-missing-data/posts/sampling-and-populations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lzachmann.github.io/models-for-missing-data/posts/sampling-and-populations/</guid><description>We sample for practical reasons. It&amp;rsquo;s usually impossible to get information on the whole population, so we use the sample to make inferences about the population. In our case, the population is typically all sites in a stratum or all sites &amp;ndash; in all strata &amp;ndash; in a park unit. What do we mean by inferences? Once we have a sample, typically we have three questions.
What&amp;rsquo;s the best estimate of the population mean?</description></item></channel></rss>
