Data come from the imaginary park "ELDO" in the similarly fictitious network "M4MD". For now, at least, sample covariate and location information vary at the site scale, and not more finely. We have not induced spatial structure in the residuals. Thus, no spatial structure should be apparent in the results unless the spatially structured covariate, `w1`, is _not_ included in the model.
